<h2>Part two</h2>
<p>
  So I've been playing the second South Parkgame, really good. Plenty of jokes, good combat, really responsive, and a story that has so far pointed out why and for what reason people actually gravitate towards Superheroes. I'd actually suggest anyone who is interested in Superheroes to play this game. Some of the subtle in-between moments cna be pretty deep if looked at with the right lens. Even Kyle's problems with his cousin echo what Kiteman(Kyle's Superhero persona) are about. In modern day many people try to politicize Superman's origin story when it was really just away for someone who never felt like they fit-in to fill strong. It's really unique. Mini-games are pretty damn hard though, and someone should have given Ubisoft the memo that says nobody like quick-time events
