## Danny Young
Currently I want to finish my Area in Computer Science and enter the video game industry as either an actualy Gameplay Programmer
or as an AI programmer. I figure either would be fun, although making progress in eliminating poor enemy AI would be a real dream.

## Places I'd like to work at
I'd like to work at[Creative Assembly] (https://www.creative-assembly.com/home) or
[ZeniMax] (https://jobs.zenimax.com/) or
[Obsidian] (https://www.obsidian.net/). But anywhere I can get a job in the industry works for me
